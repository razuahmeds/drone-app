            When it comes to drone prices in Bangladesh, there are many factors
            to consider. The price of a drone can vary based on its features,
            specifications, and brand. Here is a breakdown of drone prices in
            Bangladesh based on their categories:
          </p>
          <h3>Toy Drones</h3>
        </div>
        <div className="text">
          <p>
            Toy drones are the most affordable and basic type of drone
            available. They are usually small in size, have low-quality cameras,
            and are not meant for professional use. Toy drones are ideal for
            beginners who want to learn how to fly a drone before investing in a
            more expensive one. In Bangladesh, toy drones can cost anywhere
            between Tk 5,000 to Tk 10,000.
          </p>
          <h3>Entry-Level Drones</h3>
        </div>
        <div className="text">
          <p>
            Mid-range drones are perfect for serious hobbyists and professionals
            who want to capture high-quality aerial photographs and videos. They
            come with better cameras, longer battery life, and more advanced
            features such as obstacle avoidance, follow me mode, and return to
            home function. In Bangladesh, mid-range drones can cost anywhere
            between Tk 50,000 to Tk 1,50,000.
          </p>
          <h3>Professional Drones</h3>
        </div>
        <div className="text">
          <p>
            Professional drones are the most expensive and advanced type of
            drone available in the market. They are designed for professional
            use and are used for commercial purposes such as aerial surveys,
            mapping, and inspection. They come with the most advanced features
            such as high-resolution cameras, long-range transmission, and
            advanced sensors. In Bangladesh, professional drones can cost
            anywhere between Tk 2,00,000 to Tk 8,00,000.
          </p>
          <h3>Factors Affecting Drone Prices in Bangladesh</h3>
        </div>
        <div className="text">
          <p>
            Apart from the type of drone, there are other factors that can
            affect drone prices in Bangladesh. These include:
          </p>
          <h3>Brand</h3>
        </div>
        <div className="text">
          <p>
            The brand of the drone can greatly affect its price. Popular brands
            such as DJI and Parrot are known for their high-quality drones, but
            they also come with a higher price tag compared to lesser-known
            brands.
          </p>
          <h3>Features</h3>
        </div>
        <div className="text">
          <p>
            The features of the drone also play a major role in its price.
            Drones with advanced features such as obstacle avoidance, GPS, and
            follow me mode are usually more expensive compared to drones with
            basic features.
          </p>
          <h3>Availability</h3>
        </div>
        <div className="text">
          <p>
            The availability of the drone in Bangladesh can also affect its
            price. Drones that are not readily available in Bangladesh may be
            more expensive compared to those that are widely available.
          </p>
          <h3>Conclusion</h3>
        </div>
        <div className="text">
          <h3>Consider to buy your first Drone</h3>
          <p>
            I want to do a little article for any of you out there who are
            thinking about getting into drones. There’s a lot that I’ve learned
            over the last seven years that I’ve been flying drones, and I just
            wanted to do a short video, and just kind of share with you share,
            from my experience, the things that I think any new pilot needs to
            know before you buy a drone.
            <p>
              Alright, so the first thing I want to say is no matter where it is
              that you live in the world. More importantly, it’s wherever you
              intend on flying.
            </p>
            <p>
              You need to make sure that you are legally able to do so for those
              of you out there who are in the United States. The FAA does make
              an app called before you fly; it’s a free app; you can get it from
              your app store. So do your research. And make sure that before you
              even go ahead and buy a drone, you can legally fly it wherever you
              want.
            </p>
            <p>
              Another thing just about laws in general with drones is that many
              times when you hear a lot of times about people getting busted for
              flying, and in illegal locations, they don’t get busted. Usually,
              when they’re filming, it’s when they post it to social media. And
              so you should have the expectation that if you post any drone
              video online, whether it’s on YouTube or whatever social network
              if you use any keyword that includes the word drone includes the
              loan, know is probably going to pop up on someone’s radar. And if
              you are not doing things legally, that is usually where you get in
              trouble.
            </p>
            <p>
              Now when you’re deciding which drone actually to purchase, of
              course, the price will be a significant thing on a lot of people’s
              minds. Back in the day, when I first started doing this stuff,
              it’s like there was no way that you’re getting through this, at
              least spending 15 $100.
            </p>
            <p>
              Now the prices have come way down. One of the ones that I
              recommend I just checked out this morning on Amazon, whose prices
              can change all the time. For the version that I would recommend,
              it was just over $400. And that’s with the accessory kit. But the
              thing that I’m getting that other than price is that you consider
              wind speed.
            </p>
            <p>
              {" "}
              For example, where I live in the world, we never really have wind
              speeds that are low wind speeds that are less than around 14 miles
              an hour. When you’re on the ocean, that’s not going to happen.
            </p>{" "}
            <p>
              So if you live in a particularly windy area, you might need to
              consider that, you know, a cheap drone versus a more expensive
              drone may be the difference between actually being able to fly and
              never being able to fly for this reason alone. That’s why I
              purchased my current favourite drone, which is the DJI Mavic air,
              this little puppy that folds up all these propellers fold down.
              This can 22 miles an hour winds. It also shoots 4k videos, which I
              love. So something to consider wind speed before you make your
              first purchase. Depending on which drone you end up buying,
              sometimes when you buy a drone these days, you can buy a couple of
              versions. For example, on Amazon, they usually sell either the
              drone by itself, or you can get it with a kit. And a kit usually
              includes a couple of different things. It can include extra
              batteries; sometimes, it didn’t. But the most important thing here
              is the remote control. Let me give an example. So this right here
              is a great little drone called the DJI Spark, while you can fly it
              just from your cell phone. The problem is, is that your cell phone
              doesn’t have the kind of wireless range to allow you to get very
              far before it disconnects. It’s right around 80 feet.
            </p>{" "}
            <p>
              To get a lot of the impressive shots that people tend to desire,
              you need to be able to go a little bit further than that. For
              that, you need a dedicated remote. So across the board, no matter
              who you are, whatever purpose it is that you’re looking at
              possibly getting into this stuff. Always buy the kit that includes
              a remote control. Another reason to get that kit, by the way, is
              that one of the things you have to expect when you do fly drones
              is that they regularly release new firmware updates. And so I
              can’t even tell you the number of times that I’ve taken one of my
              drones out ready to get potentially even a clear shot. And I have
              to wait 10 minutes for it to finish doing software updates. So
              that’s why it’s always a good idea to have more than one battery.
              You have to be prepared that potentially the majority of one
              battery might get used up just in running firmware updates that
              happen all the time. Another thing to include with your little bag
              of stuff when you go droning sunglasses, it’s straightforward to
              look at the sun accidentally.
            </p>{" "}
            <p>
              And at that moment, you’ve got that blindness and sometimes very
              hard to locate your drone. If you accidentally look at the sun.
              I’ve gotten to the point where now I keep an extra pair of
              sunglasses in my drone whenever I go out filming now. At the same
              time, we live in the era of trying to achieve the perfect thing
              that I want to always remind folks about: yes, you can always
              spend more money on getting a camera that has, you know, better
              quality better than that. The thing is that if you’re good at
              editing, you can make anything look amazing. For those of you out
              there who are into video, I’ve done a ton of different classes, by
              the way, updated class on Final Cut Pro. Come on very soon. I’ve
              also done classes on iMovie. But for those of you out there who
              are into photography, of course, there are a million different
              apps out there. You can use it to make your photos look better.
              There’s one piece of software I do want to give a quick shout-out
              to. I’ve mentioned it before in my past classes, and it is
              available for both Mac and Windows, which is called photo lemur
              two. If you want to check it out, there’s a little link that will
              appear somewhere around up here for those watching me on YouTube.
              When you’re out and about filming with your drone, one of the
              things that can happen very commonly is you can temporarily lose
              your video feed. The thing that’s important to remember here is
              that just because you might lose the video feed, you see the drone
              moving, but the image you see on your cell phone is. Still, the
              critical thing to remember is that you can still control the
              drone. It’s a separate signal from the video. So one of the things
              that can cause people to freak out, in general, is they think they
              lost all transmission. You haven’t just lost video transmission.
              So if you have this encounter, if that happens to you, the vital
              thing to remember is maybe don’t go so far away.
            </p>{" "}
            <p>
              Try to bring it back a little bit to reconnect that and always fly
              within a safe range. At this point, what I would like to do is I’d
              like to introduce you to my little drone family, show you what I’m
              flying these days. But there’s a little disclaimer here. Drones
              are like iPhones; there’s a new one every year. So if you want to
              see which drones that I’m currently recommending, make sure you
              head over to my website at Tech Talk America COMM, And this is the
              page for product recommendations. You’ll find everything you need
              right there. So let’s meet the family. So this little puppy is
              drone Crawford, also known as my DJI Spark. You will notice a
              little theme, by the way, in how I name my drones. So the DJI
              Spark, as you can see here, it is so small, it lands in the palm
              of your hand. I tend to think of this as a great family drone. If
              you want to go out with the kids, go hiking somewhere and get out
              kind of excellent shot at the very end there. This is a great
              drone to be able to throw into your bag. It’s lightweight; it’s
              easy to use. I love it, big, big fan. The next one I want to show
              you is my current favourite drone. I use this thing all the time.
              Brand new DJI Maverick air again, minimal, very compact, foldable,
              as you can see here, the legs fold down, the propellers fold in
              such back propellers fold down. And when you’re done, check out
              how small that puppy is right like that. So what I love about this
              little drone, as I already made kind of a reference to this, can
              withstand 22 miles an hour winds, which for me is a huge
              difference. Shoots 4k video shoots trama raw, all the essential
              features that most people care about this thing can do.
            </p>{" "}
            <p>
              While both this and the DJI spark have autonomous modes, this has
              a few more that I find are pretty darn impressive. And finally,
              the last drone that I want to introduce you to is one that I would
              not recommend that you buy. So this used to be my favourite drone.
              It’s huge. It takes two hands for me to do this. This is the
              unique typhoon h which, as you can see here, ‘s got a 4k camera on
              its six blades. Here’s the problem. It takes me about five minutes
              to be able to get this puppy ready to run. And a lot of times,
              when you see that amazing sunset, five minutes can be the
              difference between your great shotgun and still calm but not quite
              as cool as it could have been. Also, this is incredibly heavy to
              lug around requires a backpack. The remote control is like this
              big. So my point here is that that drone replaced the drys drone.
              So don’t think necessarily that bigger, better when it comes to
              drones. Many times it’s the opposite. So what I wanted to do at
              this point is for those of you out there who will be first-time
              pilots, I want to share with you the most common reasons why
              drones crash. If you can learn these lessons now, prevent a
              potential disaster in the future. So let’s go through them and no
              real particular order. The first reason I found many drones crash
              has to do with disorientation on the part of the pilot. Let me
              give you an example of this. So if I’m flying away from me,
              forwards is forwards, backward is backward, right is right, left,
              the part where people get mixed up in When the drone is facing
              them, so what a lot of times people will do is they’ll get a
              little bit too close to an object like let’s say a tree. Their
              initial instinct was to move away from the tree, which, from their
              perspective, is right, not realizing that right is right into the
              tree.
            </p>{" "}
            <p>
              So especially when you’re starting, it’s an excellent idea, of
              course, to fly in open areas, but also to try the drone always
              facing away from you. The second most common reason, which I
              originally had, is first on my list is compass interference. And
              this just kind of, in general, goes along with signal
              interference. We are dealing with wireless signals, transmitting
              from your cell phone and the remote control to the drone itself.
              So one of the things that you can do to avoid problems is to stay
              away from large metal objects. Now, I have had two incidences
              where I had compass interference. It only led to a minor issue. It
              just popped off our propeller; it wasn’t that bad. It had been a
              lot worse. So here’s what you want to do, you want to stay away
              from large metal objects, like cell phone towers, water towers,
              bridges, anything that has a lot of metal, or that’s potentially
              emitting large radiofrequency. The third reason I found a lot of
              people crash is they want to pull up, they want to do some
              autonomous shot, which is very, very cool, but they don’t have the
              space to pull it off. Now, this is easier with some modes and
              harder other ones. For example, in the DJI Maverick air, there’s a
              Boomerang mode. Just kind of whip around you. It does this big
              circle; there’s a couple of other similar modes. But the idea here
              is it’s making large circles around an object. The problem is that
              if you don’t have the clearance, it can be tough to stop it in
              time drawing. So make sure if you’re going to do an autonomous
              shot, make sure it’s the kind of shot where you have no obstacles.
              The fourth reason returned to home crash.
